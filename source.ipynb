    "\n",
    "The problem I'm trying to address relates to the frequent concussions in professional football, which often times leads to CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) after the playing career. This has a large impact on the brains ability to process and respond to information, as well as many other negatives effects that inhibit ones ability to continue living their life. I'd like to look into current trends in professional football (NCAA/NFL) regarding concussion protocol and see how things have shifted in recent years as technology has advanced. In theory, you'd assume the amount of concussions would be reduced due to the new technology within the helmets to help with traumatic blows to the head area, but it seems as though the number of concussions has stayed relatively the same throughout everything. I'd like to research this more."

    "- At 6 concussions and beyond in an athletes playing career, they are statistically likely to be diagnosed with CTE.\n",
    "- At 4 career concussions, the likelihood of being diagnosed with CTE jumps significantly.\n",
    "- In the NFL, players at skill positions (QB, WR, RB, DB) typically miss more time while being in concussion protocol.\n",
    "- Players between ages 21-25 spend significantly less time in concussion protocol in comparison to players aged 26-30."
